# Colorful (Simplified) ES-DE Add-On: 720p System Video

This is an add-on for the [Colorful (Simplified)](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/colorful-simplified-es-de) theme for ES-DE. 

It adds video playback to the system view with videos from the Colorful platform video set (originally created by [Viking](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/70421-viking/) for Launchbox)

The original source for the videos in this repo can be found [here](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/1958-colorful-platform-video-set/).

This repo simply made the following changes:

- Changed the names to map to ES-DE's system naming convention
- Converted the 4k source to 720p using HandBrake's default "Fast 720p" profile and changing framerate to match the source
- Added hooks to allow this set to be used as an add-on for the [Colorful (Simplified)](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/colorful-simplified-es-de) theme for ES-DE

## Usage:

TBA

## Credits:

- All credit for the creation of the system videos goes to [Viking](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/70421-viking/) and others for their work on the original Launchbox theme [[Source](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/1958-colorful-platform-video-set/)]
